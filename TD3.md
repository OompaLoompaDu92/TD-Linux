# Display the list of files and folders at the root using ls -l
ls -l / 

# In a pipeline (using |), append a grep instruction to only display informations of bin
ls -l / | grep "bin"

# Append an awk instruction to only display the size of bin
ls -l / | grep "bin" | awk '{print $5}'

# Now rather extract the month, day and year of creation of the folder bin
ls -ld /bin | awk '{print $6,$7,$8}'

# Now rearrange the instruction to get the following output format : 2020-Oct-26 (from original data : Oct 26 2020)
ls -ld /bin | awk '{print $6"-"substr($1,1,3)"-"$2}'

grep -o "meta [^ ]*" cyberattacks.txt

# Only extract the follwing word (but not the keyword "meta")
grep -oP "(?<=meta )[^\s]*" cyberattacks.txt
